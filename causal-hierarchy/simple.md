### 1. Association (Seeing/Observing)

**What it means:** At this level, we are just looking at data to see if things tend to happen together. We are spotting patterns and correlations.

**Example:** If we notice that people who smoke are more likely to get lung cancer, we are observing an association. We see that these two things are related, but we don't know if one causes the other.

### 2. Intervention (Doing)

**What it means:** Here, we think about what happens if we take action to change something. We are interested in the effects of our actions.

**Example:** If we make people stop smoking and then check to see if fewer of them get lung cancer, we are intervening. We want to see if our action (making people stop smoking) leads to a specific outcome (less lung cancer).

### 3. Counterfactuals (Imagining)

**What it means:** At this highest level, we imagine different scenarios to understand what might have happened if things were different. We are thinking about "what if" situations.

**Example:** If a person got lung cancer and we wonder, "What if this person had never smoked? Would they still have gotten lung cancer?" we are using counterfactual thinking. We are imagining an alternate reality to understand the cause-and-effect relationship.

### Summary:

1. **Association:** We see things happening together (like smoking and lung cancer).
2. **Intervention:** We change something to see what happens (make people stop smoking and see if lung cancer rates drop).
3. **Counterfactuals:** We imagine different scenarios to understand cause and effect (wonder if a smoker who got cancer would have been cancer-free if they hadn't smoked).

Each level helps us understand more about how things are connected and what causes what.
